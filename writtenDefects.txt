Informal bugs & defects:
- Non-peristent Data in SQL database (High)
- Edit Numerical Habit Dialog EditView not showing current value (Low)
- Minor visual bug with Numerical Icon (Medium)
- Tried adding field in incorrect SQL object (caught by peer coming back from lunch break on two ocasions)
- 

Formal Code Inspection:
- General formatting
- Naming convention, clearer names could be used (Habit.java)
- Lacks defensive programming with NonNull time (Habit.java, ChackmarkButtonController.java)
- Initialize variables when the window is created (BaseDialogHelper.java)
- Prototyping code was left in (NumericalHabitDialog.java)
- IF statement that is never executed (BaseScreen.java)
- 



Static Analysis (IntelliJ):

- String Bug -- incorrect use of equals (== instead of .equals)
- Unnecessary Statement -- Function that was never called/never reached
- Not importing correct libraries
- Reserved Keyword being used as variable (changed type variable to typeN)


Regression Testing (Manual, UI heavy features)
- Did evolutionary prototyping / phased incremental lifecycle
- Continual tested all features upon the integration of a new feature
